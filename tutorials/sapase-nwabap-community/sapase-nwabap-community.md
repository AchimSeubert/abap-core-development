### Check the SAP Community


Check the [SAP Community site](https://community.sap.com/topics/applications-on-ase) to pick up on the latest SAP ASE news, blog posts, versions and documentation that you might have missed while doing this mission.



### Check legacy Sybase wiki


One page worth mentioning is the [Legacy Sybase Wiki](http://www.petersap.nl/SybaseWiki/index.php/Main_Page). Here you can find information on several products, amongst them is SAP ASE.

There also is information on [running SAP ASE in Docker](http://www.petersap.nl/SybaseWiki/index.php/Docker_-_How_to_run_Sybase_ASE_in_a_container)

>**Tip for your internet searches:** A lot of blog post refer to "Sybase ASE", and not "SAP ASE".




### Up-to-date information: GitHub!


Where else would you find the latest and greatest information, were it not for GitHub.

In GitHub, search for "ASE" and "Docker" and have a look at the [result list](https://github.com/search?q=ase+docker).
