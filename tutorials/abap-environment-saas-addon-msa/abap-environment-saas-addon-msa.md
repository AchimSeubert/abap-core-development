### Understand the Maintain Solution Application

Once you have created your product and built a new product version using the Build Product Version app, you can use the Maintain Solution app.

The Maintain Solution app allows:

- Creation and maintenance of the necessary configuration settings for your SaaS solution.
- Configuration of deployment settings of the solution
- Triggering the deployment of your solution to SAP BTP Cloud Foundry so that your consumers can subscribe to it.

At the end of this process, your consumers will be able to subscribe to your SaaS solution.

The following figure shows the steps to be followed.
