### Access Security and Roles


1.	In the SAP Data Warehouse Cloud welcome page, click on **Security** on the menu on the left-hand side.

    <!-- border -->![Security](T01- Security.png)

2.	Select **Roles** from the dropdown menu

3.	You can now see a list of Data Warehouse Cloud Roles. DW Administrator role has the complete set of privileges in the tenant.



### Create custom role


When you want to provide a user with admin-like role and at the same time want to prevent them from creating new users and roles like a limited admin access, creating a custom role is the best option.

1.	In the **Roles** landing page, scroll down and click on the plus icon to create a new role.

    <!-- border -->![Link text e.g., Destination screen](New.png)

2.	In the next dialog, give a meaningful name to the custom role you want to create.

    <!-- border -->![Link text e.g., Destination screen](rolename.png)

3.	You can also select a template for the new role for example a template of DW Modeler in the next dialog, in the video above, you can see an example of blank template role being selected.

4.	Now you can give **Create**, **Read**, **Update**, **Execute**, **Maintain**, **Share** and **Manage** access. In the video above, you can see an example of **Space Management** access in SAP Data Warehouse Cloud given to the sample role created.

5.	Once the required access privileges are assigned, you can save the role by clicking the *Save** icon.

### Change role configuration


1.	In the role assign menu (Item 4 of Step 2), you can configure the newly created custom roles according to the requirements.

2.	Click on the settings icon to access the **Role Configuration**.

    <!-- border -->![Link text e.g., Destination screen](Settings.png)

3.	You can now see the option to mark the newly created custom role to be assigned as default or full data access role. You can also enable a self-service which the user can use to request for access themselves.

### Access to user specific data


Data Access Control helps you to fine-tune data access for each user in a view. No need to create additional Spaces or duplicate data models â€“ simply define access rights based on the username and the row content.

You will see in detail on how to achieve this in the below video.
