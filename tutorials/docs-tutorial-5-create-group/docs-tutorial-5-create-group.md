# Create a Tutorial Mission or Group
<!-- description --> Put a set of tutorials together to form a tutorial mission or group, so users can perform a more substantial and meaningful task.

## You will learn 
  - How to request a tutorial mission or group  

## Intro
Even before publishing your tutorials, you should have been in consultation with evangelists and [Daniel Wroblewski](mailto:daniel.wroblewski@sap.com) to design your missions and groups.

Once your tutorials are publishing, make a formal request for missions or groups.

---

### Important considerations


1. We do not want to delete missions and groups after we have created them, so the tutorials/groups/missions that you create should last a while -- years!

    - **Create only what will last and what you can support over the long haul.**

    - **Plan ahead, preferably for the next 12 to 24 months.**

    >Of course, you can update tutorials at any time, as well as add or subtract individual tutorials within a group/mission as the technology changes.

2. Create groups/missions that build things, that give a goal to the user.

    >**No marketing!** Provide instructions for building example apps.

3. Each group/mission needs an icon. Make sure you have provided one for your technology/service/product.

### Send information on groups/missions


Send the following information for each group and mission (you can copy the table into an email) to [Joshua Margo](mailto:joshua.margo@sap.com):

|  Info        | Value
|  :------------- | :-------------
|  Group/Mission title            |  &nbsp;
|  Group/Mission description           | Describe what the user will do/create (no marketing)
|  Experience     | Beginner / Intermediate / Advanced
|  Primary Tag            | &nbsp;
|  Secondary Tags     | &nbsp;
|  Time to Complete  | &nbsp;

Add an ordered list of the tutorials/groups in your group/mission. For each tutorial/group, provide:

  - Title
  - URL (to QA is OK)

>You can only specify tags that exist. For more information on tags, see [Tags](https://jam4.sapjam.com/groups/A7NmsKmoG9vVaxizKhdQOk/overview_page/qaqhwSll2Gk0r7KJnzxTCT).
