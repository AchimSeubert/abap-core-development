# Define and Expose a CDS-Based Travel Data Model
<!-- description --> Define CDS-based data model and create projection view.

## Prerequisites  
<<<<<<< HEAD
- You need an SAP BTP, ABAP environment [trial user](abap-environment-trial-onboarding) or a license.
- You have downloaded and installed the [latest ABAP Development Tools (ADT)] (https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#abap).
=======
- You need to have access to an SAP BTP, ABAP environment, or SAP S/4HANA Cloud, ABAP environment or SAP S/4HANA (release 2021 or higher) system.
For example, you can create [free trial user on SAP BTP, ABAP environment](abap-environment-trial-onboarding).
- You have downloaded and installed the [latest ABAP Development Tools (ADT)] (https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#abap) on the latest EclipseÂ© platform.
- If you are using a **licensed system** make sure, that the flight scenario is available in your system. If not, you should follow these [steps](https://help.sap.com/docs/btp/sap-abap-restful-application-programming-model/downloading-abap-flight-reference-scenario) in your licensed system. The flight scenario is already in the trial systems.

### Define CDS-based travel data model

<<<<<<< HEAD
  1. Right-click on your package `ZTRAVEL_APP_XXX`, select **New** > **Other ABAP Repository Object**.

      ![Define CDS based travel data model](model.png)

  2. Search for data definition, select it and click **Next >**.

      ![Define CDS based travel data model](model2.png)

  3. Create a data definition:

     - Name: `ZI_TRAVEL_M_XXX`
=======
  1. Right-click on database table `ZATRAVEL_###` and select **New Data Definition**.

      ![Define CDS based travel data model](model.png)

=======
     - Name: `ZUI_TRAVEL_###`
>>>>>>> 59f95048a11e62962d5c8eb49e89b6f027533a25

>>>>>>> 59f95048a11e62962d5c8eb49e89b6f027533a25

  3. Click **Finish** to use your transport request.

      ![Create service definition](definition3.png)

<<<<<<< HEAD
  4. Replace your code with following:

    ```ABAP
    @EndUserText.label: 'Service Definition for ZC_Travel_M_XXX'
    define service ZUI_C_TRAVEL_M_XXX
    {
      expose ZC_TRAVEL_M_XXX as TravelProcessor;
=======
  4. Expose these entities:

    ```ABAP
    @EndUserText.label: 'Service definition for travel'
    define service ZUI_Travel_### {
      expose ZC_TravelTP_### as TravelProcessor;
>>>>>>> 59f95048a11e62962d5c8eb49e89b6f027533a25
      expose /DMO/I_Customer as Passenger;
      expose /DMO/I_Agency as TravelAgency;
      expose /DMO/I_Airport as Airport;
      expose I_Currency as Currency;
      expose I_Country as Country;

    }   
=======
    }  
>>>>>>> 59f95048a11e62962d5c8eb49e89b6f027533a25
    ```

  5. Save and activate.

      ![save and activate](activate.png)

     With the **service definition** you are able to define which data is exposed as a business service in your travel booking application.


### Create service binding

<<<<<<< HEAD
  1. Right-click on your service definition `ZUI_C_TRAVEL_M_XXX` and select **New Service Binding**.
=======
  1. Right-click on service definition `ZUI_TRAVEL_###` and select **New Service Binding**.
>>>>>>> 59f95048a11e62962d5c8eb49e89b6f027533a25

      ![Create service binding](binding.png)

     - Description: `Service binding for travel`
     - Binding Type: `ODATA V2 - UI`

     Click **Next >**.

      ![Create service binding](binding2.png)

  3. Click **Finish** to use your transport request.

      ![Create service binding](binding3.png)

  4. **Activate** your service binding and then **publish** it.

      ![Create service binding](binding4.png)

     Now your service binding is created and you are able to see your service with its entities and associations.

<<<<<<< HEAD
     The **service binding** allows you to bind the service definition to an ODATA protocol. Therefore you are able to see the travel booking application on the UI.
