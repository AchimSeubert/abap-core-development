### The Case for Business Processes and Their Management

You might be wondering why we started this course about Low-Code / No-Code Applications and Automations for Citizen Developers with a primer on business processes. The reason is that business processes, and the optimization of business processes, are a vital part of a winning company with happy employees.

The visibility, efficiency, and effectiveness of business processes ensure that organizations achieve, and even exceed, their goals and allow companies to differentiate themselves in highly competitive markets. Well-defined and managed processes supported by low-code / no-code technologies empower businesspeople to take direct ownership of their work and improve it, without having to defer to the IT department for every new idea.

You, as a citizen developer, can become more effective and amplify your impact by understanding business processes and their management, and then determining what parts of your daily work are suitable for you to automate and support with applications.
