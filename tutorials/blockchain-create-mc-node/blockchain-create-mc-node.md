### Understand MultiChain on SAP Cloud Platform


The MultiChain service on SAP Cloud Platform lets you create, delete, monitor, and maintain individual MultiChain nodes and then connect them to a blockchain network.

This service is supported by Small, Medium, Large, and Connect Your Own Network productive service plans.

In addition to productive service plans, we also offer a Trial service plan on the trial landscape. This plan comes with the following conditions:

- One trial service instance per SAP Cloud Platform Global Account

- Service instances expire after 14 days, including the loss of the blockchain data (if not synced to a wider network), wallet data (public and private keys), and external IP addresses used to connect to other nodes.

- An existing service instance, whether expired or not, must be deleted before a new service instance can be provisioned within the Global Account.


### Open the MultiChain Service


Once on the SAP Cloud Platform Service Marketplace, locate and open the MultiChain service by clicking the relevant service tile:

### Navigate to Instances


Once in the MultiChain service, you will see a service description and the available plans. In this tutorial you will create a trial node. This allows you to provision a single testing node for a 14 day period.

Click the **Instances** tab on the side menu, opening an overview of available MultiChain instances in your subaccount:
