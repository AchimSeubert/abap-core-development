### Filter activities


If you want to know who has logged into the system, you can simply filter by clicking the filter icon for the activity and receive a log of everyone who has signed into the system.

The filter lets you choose from a larger variety of activities. For example, if you want to filter based on activity, mark the activity box and select the dropdown on the right to see the right activity type for your filter. Then click `ok`. If you want to filter based on the username, you can do so by marking the username box and writing a username you want to filter on username box provided in the active filters.
