### Understand the Maintain Solution Application

Once you have created your product and built a new product version using the Build Product Version app, you can use the Maintain Solution app to create and maintain the necessary configuration settings for your SaaS solution, its deployment and to trigger the deployment of your solution to SAP BTP Cloud Foundry so that your consumers can subscribe to it. At the end of this process, your consumers will be able to subscribe to your SaaS solution.

The following figure shows the steps to be followed.

### Maintain Credentials to be used during deployment

    a. General Settings - Unique ID for the deployment along with an optional description

    b. Target - Specify where your solution shall be deployed. Note that the technical user with Space Developer rights in the targeted Cloud Foundry space is required. You should have already created this user in the Credentials tab (Refer step 2 -"Maintain CREdentials to be used during deployment")

    c. Routing information - in this step you specify the routing information for your solution to determine the final URL for consumers to access.  The subdomain can be identified from the overview page of your subaccount in the BTP Cockpit.

If an icon is yellow: The step is currently in progress.
If the icon is red : There is an error. Scan the log to find more information on the error.
If an icon is blue: The step was completed successfully.
